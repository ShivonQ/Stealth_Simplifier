# Stealth_Simplifier
A easier way to do stealth/hide checks over a long distance.  Works with almost any d20 rpg system.


This version comes with some test data, and currently no way to delete or save permanently characters from/to the pool of available ones.
The next version will likely only have a single class for Char(instead of PC and NPC.) That way I can run stealth checks against my players of my NPCs

It uses Tabluate, poorly.  But it is a little better than hamfisting my own version of table formatting.
